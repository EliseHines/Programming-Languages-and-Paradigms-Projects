I worked on this in Pycharm and tested it using the UH linux server.

Notable things:
 - If I name my file keyword.py, the server wont let me compile my code. But if i name it anything else it works
So my file name is keywords.py so I can compile my code properly.
 - I used recursive selection sort found on geeksforgeeks
 - My partner did not help or message me at all this assignment
so i had to settle for what i could get.
 - There are many cases where I probably didnt follow mutation rules. I tried my hardest though
