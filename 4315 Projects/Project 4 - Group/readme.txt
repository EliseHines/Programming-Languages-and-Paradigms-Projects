Notes:
 - did not implement parenthesis for time sake, will pass with parenthesis removed
 - did not implement if statements or function calls for time sake as well
 - size is an issue, we can only hold a certain amount of data since 
we didnt have alot of time
 - we didnt look at alot of the specific error test cases for lack of time
