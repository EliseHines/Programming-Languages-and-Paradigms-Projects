Different careers

That's in keeping with a long-running trend, according to a recent report from the National Foundation for American Policy. 
Immigrants have won 38% of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in chemistry, medicine and physics since 2000, and 35% of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in those fields since 1901, the foundation says.
